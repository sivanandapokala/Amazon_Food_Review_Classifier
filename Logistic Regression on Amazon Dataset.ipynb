Of the 5 different sauces that I bought that day this was the first one that I opened.  I have to say that I am very disappointed.<br /><br />I am really not too sure why it tastes so bad to me.  Here is what the label says is in it:<br /><br />Purified water, soybean oil, jalapeno chilies, cane sugar, wine vinegar, fresh tomatillo, Wasabi Rhizome, salt, lime juice, cilantro, ginger, mustard powder, green tea leaf, vitamin C, garlic powder, onion powder, turmeric, citric acid and sodium eritobate.<br /><br />It could be the large amount of soybean oil but the sauce tastes dull and cloying.  I was hoping for that nasal-passage-clearing rush of Wasabi but I could barely delete it\\'s flavor.  For a brand that has HEAT on the label it\\'s too bad that there was none inside of the bottle.  The green tea leaf adds to the visual aspect of the condiment (with all of the floating bits of it and the cilantro) but not the taste.  I just could be me or the bottle that I purchased, but I don\\'t like it and I regret buying it.',\n",

Another thing is I ain\\'t even got any intestines fer sausage makin! How is Easter dinner gonna be any good with no varmint sausages? This thing looks like it coulda been a guinea pig or a chinchilla or somethin. I mean, it tasted pretty damn good with hot sauce, but I reckon I oughta shot my own critter next time around. That or scrape one up off the main road, sure is cheaper. Least they left some bones in there for my ol coonhound to chaw awhile.

He played with it once, then it broke AGAIN. I finally drilled holes in the side and riveted a make-shift bracket to either half, effectively sealing the thing together for eternity (or as long as it takes for the plastic to break-down into it\\'s constituent materials). Even now the center tube hardly \"locks\" anymore. I\\'m done with this toy. The manufacturer needs to redesign the cube halves so the halves screw together.<br /><br />Even when it was brand new the center lock was VERY hard for my wife to get out.

       " \"After being fed up with the disgusting smell of clay litter and it sticking to the litter pan like glue when it got too wet, I found this litter and I'm never going back! I tried corn litter before this but it was no comparison in terms of clumping, tracking, and keeping the area odor free. Believe it or not, I use this litter with two cats in my electronic litter box...it works GREAT! If there is ever a possibility that it gets oversaturated and sticks to the bottom of the pan, it dries to a cakey consistency and I just scoop it out in seconds. With clay clumping litter my cats were tracking that litter smell all over the house, I was constantly getting a whiff of it on them too. Now, theres no odor to speak of on them or in the house and theres minimal clean up. Better yet - its natural and safe for my kids and the environment. As far as completely odor free and not enough clumping power - that would be some magical stuff to be able to de-oderize cat waste completely. . .this makes it barely noticeable though. The electronic litter box does scoop it away almost immediately so I'm sure that helps and it definately seems to have enough clumping power to be scooped away electronically.\",\n",

About a week later, my kitty (named Sugar) starting vomiting. Confused, I assumed it was the wet food we were feeding her in the morning. So we changed it. Then we changed it again. No results. I took her to the vet and asked. He checked her out and said likely the problem was having a sensitive stomach and he recommended Science Diet. Bam. My cat does great now. She's lost a little bit of weight so she's the right size now. She doesn't vomit anymore. This food works and it works well. I read the negative review here and I would say the problem was unique to the cat. My cat loves it and is doing brilliantly now.\",\n",

I not only grew my own peppers (jalapeno, habanero, and the hottest-at-its-time red savina) back in the mid-'90s but also made it a point to sample lots of hot sauces. I have a huge collection of hot sauces instead of liquor behind the home bar.<br /><br />Dave's Gourmet Insanity Sauce was the first ultra-hot sauce I've tried. What's interesting about this sauce is that it uses capsaicin extract in an oil base. This adds a lot of fury to an already fiery coarse and thick mix of tabasco and habanero peppers with a hint of smokiness within a tomato base. But you know you're into something brutal when you shake the bottle and witness the changing of the dark red contents to a fiery orange.<br /><br />The heat of this sauce creeps up on you. At first you begin delving into the already hot and slightly-smoky tastes and textures of the base. Then the extracts hit and lock onto your tongue. It's a very persistent burn that wiped that smug grin off of my face as I looked for the nearest glass of iced milk. And just when you think it's over, depending upon how much you consumed you may feel a wicked afterburn when you go and relieve the other end of your gastrointestinal tract.<br /><br />Dave's Gourmet Insanity Sauce is legendary. Even the label is worth a read. If you really want to test yourself or your friends you can't go wrong with this just for the burn.\",\n",

It bugged my other plants. However, its a cutting of a shrub, not a bonsai. Its just stuck in a bonsai pot. Now I'm in the bug spraying mode- frustrating. It would have been easier to care for it as a plant, since its buggy. Now I have to train it into a bonsai. It seems root bound, but we're not supposed to anything the first year. Gardenias are hardy but delicate so I'm frustrated with spraying for bugs and for the season I have to bring it in and I hate bugs.\",\n",
